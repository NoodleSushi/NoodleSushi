# Heya!~ 👋

I'm **Noodle**! a computer science graduate, programmer, game developer, web developer, and freelance music producer & composer.

I started in game development, which shaped how I think about software today: interactive, responsive, and meant to be experienced rather than just used. I now work mostly on web projects, focusing on frontend implementation while gradually expanding my understanding of backend systems when projects call for it.

I often collaborate with artists for visual direction, but I pay close attention to UI/UX details during implementation such as spacing, accessibility, contrast, typography, and the small decisions that make interfaces feel intentional.

Alongside programming, I also make music and enjoy multimedia projects that sit at the intersection of technology and creativity. I also have a soft spot for data modeling and ERD design when working with structured systems.

> I like turning ideas into things people can actually poke, click, and experience.
